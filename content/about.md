I am an Electrical Engineer by training, and a musician by heart.
I am a former Ph.D. student in Security and Cryptography at Lund University, Sweden.

I have a passion for learning and creating (un)necessary things, which is why I always have
one too many projects going on. I love everything related to electronics, from hardcore analog,
digital, FPGA, ASIC, embedded, to operating systems, network, and of course security.

I am a guitarist turned bassist, and I am now a full-time slapper.
I have trained martials arts for many years, which helped me slap even harder.

I love the smell of soldering tin in the morning.
